Description - 
 
This is an HTML code for a simple responsive landing page. Let me explain it in simple terms:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This line tells the web browser that the document is written in HTML.

<html lang="en">: This is the start of the HTML document. It sets the language of the page to English.

<head>: This section contains information about the web page, like its title and linked stylesheets.

<meta charset="UTF-8">: It specifies the character encoding for the page (UTF-8, which supports many characters).

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This tag ensures that the page adapts to different screen sizes (responsive design).

<title>Responive-landing-page</title>: This sets the title of the webpage to "Responive-landing-page."

<link rel="stylesheet" href="output.css">: It links an external CSS stylesheet called "output.css" for styling the page.

<body>: This is where the main content of the webpage goes.

<header>: This section is for the website's header, which typically contains a logo, navigation menu, and maybe some other elements.

<nav>: Inside the header, there's a navigation menu with links like "Home," "About Us," etc.

<button>: This is a button labeled "Geek" with an icon. It's often used for actions or navigation.

<section>: This is a content section of the webpage.

<h1>: It's a big heading that says "Before they sold out readymade gluten."

<p>: A paragraph of text explaining something about the page.

<button>: Two buttons labeled "Yes" and "No."

<img>: An image is included in this section, which is displayed on the webpage.

In essence, this HTML code creates a simple webpage with a header, navigation menu, a section with a title, some text, and buttons, and an image. The page is designed to be responsive, meaning it will adjust to different screen sizes for
